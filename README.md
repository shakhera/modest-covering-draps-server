## Backend
Our backend infrastructure is built using Node.js and Express.js, along with MongoDB as our database solution. This combination allows us to create a robust and scalable server-side architecture to handle various tasks, including user authentication, data management, and API integrations.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime environment that enables us to run server-side code. Node.js provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for building fast and scalable network applications.
- Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building APIs and web servers. Express.js provides a robust set of features for routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. MongoDB is highly scalable and schema-less, allowing us to store and manage complex data structures efficiently.
- Mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose provides a straightforward way to model application data, define schemas, and perform CRUD operations.
